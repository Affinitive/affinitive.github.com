<p>As you may have noticed from the code samples we post, at Affinitive we've become big proponents of <a href="http://lithify.me" title="Lithium" target="_blank">Lithium</a>, and it has become our "go to" framework for developing our social applications.</p>
<p>We're happy to announce the formation of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Lithium-Meetup/" title="NYC Lithium Meetup Group" target="_blank">NYC Lithium Meetup group</a>!&nbsp;This group is a place for the NYC developer community to get together and learn more about <a href="http://www.lithify.me" title="Lithium" target="_blank">Lithium</a>, the first truly "modern", full-stack PHP web application framework. Whether you are already developing applications using Lithium or are simply interested in exploring a new framework, please join us the meetup and hopefully we'll see you at one of our monthly get-togethers.</p>
<p>In terms of format, instead of a single long presentation, the focus will be on quick-format demos of applications built using Lithium, hacks, tips and tricks, and general QA/discussion/networking. And in true hacker spirit, free pizza and beer will be provided! <a href="http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Lithium-Meetup/" title="NYC Lithium Meetup" target="_blank">Visit the Meetup group and join us now</a>!</p>
<p>Interested in presenting? <a href="http://www.twitter.com/BobTroia" target="_blank">Drop us a line</a>.</p>
