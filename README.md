Affinitive Dev Team Notes
=========================

Currently hosted at affinitive.github.com, but we'll setup dev.beaffinitive.com CNAME once we've migrated our content.

### Usage Tips
- [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/usage/index.html])
- [Perfect Workflow Guide](http://qubitlogs.com/Workflow/2013/01/22/jekyll-blogging-reference-and-perfect-workflow-guide/)

### Theme
Installed the Hooligan theme with `rake theme:install git="https://github.com/dhulihan/hooligan.git"`.  Plan on tweaking it.

### @todo
- Pull over existing posterous content (Sloan I made you an admin so you can get all of the content from [here](http://posterous.com/#spaces/affinitivedev/posts/edit))
- Found a tip on handling multiple authors here: [https://gist.github.com/ravasthi/1834570](https://gist.github.com/ravasthi/1834570)
- Figure out if we can preserve the permalinks we had there
- Update dev.beaffinitive.com to point here
